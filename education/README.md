In our Philippine education data visualization project, we will use the curated data by [`tjpalanca`](https://github.com/tjpalanca/education-analytics/tree/master/Data). The following files were converted from .rdata format into a python-readable format (.csv) using rdata.ipynb:

* D1 - Enrollment Data
* D2 - Schools Data
* D3 - CityMuni Data
* D4 - Schools Data Expanded
* D5 - Capacity Data
* D6 - Capacity Clustering
* D7 - Cluster Profiles

The files above are compressed into two .tar.gz files: enrolment and schools.
